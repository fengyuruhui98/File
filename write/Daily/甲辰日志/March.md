## Schedule 
work day at Ningbo

## Daily
Morning, I got up at about 08:00 and then I went to eat the breakfast and then I waited Wumin under the building and then we went there together, when we waited the taxi, Wumin and I stand under the bus station and then he said the my salary would raise this year...
Then we woked together all day and ate at the canteen of the building, ninght we went back early, and Wumin said thet I should stay here more.
Some bad feeling crashed me when Wumin called jinguangyu and said that he would went to Hangzhou and I have to stay here, and without knowing when would be the matter things came to me. Some kind of Sadness, but whatever, think bigger...
