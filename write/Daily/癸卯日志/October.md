"Down"-Yudafu
The breeze blowing from the south, like the sobering jelly, carries a fragrance and blows up.

In this peaceful early autumn world, in this clear and transparent ether, his body felt as soft as if intoxicated. It was as if he was sleeping in his mother's arms. He seemed to dream of the peach blossom source. He seemed to be on the coast of southern Europe, lying on his lover's lap, where he was greedily napping.

"Down" -- Yudafu
This is your refuge. The general philistines of the world are there to envy you, laugh at you, fool you; Only this nature, this ever-new sky, this late summer breeze, this early autumn air, or your friend, or your mother, or your lover, you don't have to go to the world to live with those light men and women, you are in the bosom of nature, this simple country is old.

A strange book like this should not be read in one go, but should be carefully chewed. After reading it all at once, my ardent desire had to be extinguished, and then I had no good hopes, no dreams, how to make it?

Looking around, the sun has slanted; On the other side of the Great Plain, on the western horizon, there is a high mountain, floating there, suffering from a day's remnants, and a hazy layer of lan air brews around the mountain, reflecting a purple and red color.

When the weather was clear, he grabbed every literary book he loved to read, and ran to the inaccessible mountainside to covet the deep taste of loneliness. In the moment of silence, in the place where the sky and water reflected, he looked at the grass, wood, insects and fish, and looked at the white clouds, and he felt that he was a lonely and proud sage, a detached and independent hermit.
During class, although he sat in the middle of the class, he always felt very lonely; In the crowd, the loneliness felt is more uncomfortable than the loneliness that a person feels in a deserted place. Looking at his classmates, they were all happily listening to his lectures there, and although he was the only one sitting in the lecture hall, his mind was like a flying cloud, and he was making boundless fantasies there.
Why should I come to Japan, why should I ask for knowledge. Since he came to Japan, he naturally had to be insulted by them Japanese. China, China! Why don't you get rich and strong, I can't endure it anymore.
"Isn't there a bright mountain and river in your hometown, and isn't your hometown a beautiful woman like a flower?" Why should I come to this island nation in the East China Sea!
"It's just a matter of coming to Japan, why should I go to this damn high school again." Wouldn't those who they had stayed for five months and returned enjoy prosperity there? These five or six years have taught me how to get by. After suffering a lot and accumulating more than ten years of knowledge, when I return to China, will I be stronger than the international students they came to mess around?
"Life is a hundred years old, when I was young, there were only seven or eight years, these purest and most beautiful seven or eight years, I had to spend in this ruthless island country, but I am already twenty-one this year.
"Twenty-one years old of Makiki!
"Dead twenty-one!
"I'm really better than the minerals, I probably haven't flowered anymore."

That day was about the third or fourth day of the old calendar, and the blue and purple sky like velvet was sprinkled with a day of stars. Half-traced crescent moon, hanging obliquely on the West Heavenly Corner, but it looks like a fairy's Emei, without the appearance of Cuidai. He leaned against the window of the third-class car alone, silently counting the lights of the people outside the window. The train was in the middle of the dark night, one by one, the stars and lights of the metropolis were also hazy little by little, and a thousand sorrows suddenly arose in his chest, and his eyes suddenly felt hot.
"The wanderers under the cross were probably as tragic as I was when they left the shores of their native land."
After the train passed Yokohama, his feelings gradually calmed down. After sitting in a daze, he took a postcard, put it on Heine's book of poems, and wrote a poem in pencil to send to his friends in Tokyo:
Emei moon on the willow at the beginning, and bid farewell to the former residence of Tianya, and the Sibi Banner Pavilion competed for wine,
The lights of the sixth street are far away with the car, chaotic and young without many tears, the luggage family is poor and only old books,
The autumn water grows in the night after the reed, and the double fish are foraged by Junnanpu.
When he walked through the park and onto the path in the middle of the rice fields, he saw that the sun had risen, and the dew drops on the rice were still hanging there like pearls. There was a clump of trees in front of it, and in the shade of the trees, a few rafter farmhouses could be seen. There were two or three chimney tubes, protruding above the farmhouse, faintly floating in the morning air. Wisps of green smoke floated there like incense, and he knew that the farmer had cooked breakfast there.

The enemy is in our mind, it's weekness, our desire to trust people, to be loved. I watch the "war march from the sea blow"..
"Down" -- Yudafu 
When he returned home, he stayed day and night in his little book. The books in the collections of his father and his eldest brother became his mentors and friends. In his diary, he remembered poems day by day. Sometimes he also used gorgeous articles to make novels, in which he regarded himself as an amorous warrior, the two daughters of his neighboring widow, as the Miao descendants of the nobility, and compiled all the customs of his hometown into pastoral scenery; When he was free, he also translated his own novels in purely foreign languages; His fantasies grew bigger and bigger, and it was around this time that the roots of his depression disease were successfully cultivated.
