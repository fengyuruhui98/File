## Daily

Today, after eating at Sis, take the rail way to PuDong T2, long trip, and because it was morning when left, so crowded in the train, before leave, went to the WC at Sis, but the stomache hitted me when arrieved PuDong airport, just finished before take off, long and thrilling trip, when arrieved, the plane was so thrilling, turned a 360° turn around, and the wind was so big that just up in one second and down in the next second. But finally, safe landed.  
When got Dalian, out of the railway on Xi'an road, my phone droped heart breaking.  
In the noon, ate galss noddles, spicy but yummy.  And the chicken bones.  
Afternoon, didn't go to the workplace, went to QuanJi hotel on Dalian HePing square, don't know whether will get here again anymore.  
Near the hotel, there was some locol people house, a little old, with strong Northern style. It's very close to Korean and Russia.  
After dinner went out, bought Xuanhemen, walk, and back, it really cold here.  
At about nine o'clock CHN sended me a message that she went to XianMen FuJian province.  
In XuMa's song "south of the thouth hill", saids, 'you are in the grate southern sunshine with snows pull down, I am in the northern icy night warm as spring'. Really dipicting the situation, between me and CHN.  

PS.this weekend plan to go somewhere.
PS.maybe CHN can come here, who knows.
