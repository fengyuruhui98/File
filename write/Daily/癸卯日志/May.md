sometimes it was not the hate between us but the unknown, I feel shamed that I never think at Shuisheng's position. Then we went to Chuzhou Zhengwu center station to do the test at the station, I stand for all the afternoon, and in the time, I went to the toilet, located at the leave level and I asked the secury for the key.

Morning, I wake up at about 7:30 and dreamed a lot, for dad and the bad dream. Then I went down stairs and met SHuisheng at the elevator.

The air was so wet and warm that I felt really hot.
Then the station was full of water and really wet. we worked all the morning and then we didn't want to went outside, so we ordered the lunch and the delivery send the food slow and the station door was closed and opened the other side. 
The chicken entrails tastes not good. But was good together with the rice. Then we worked all the afternoon. 
There I had learned something that never let your level went down to those people and they will use theirs' strong experience to beats you. Never ever let youself went down to their level...
Then night we went to the Liuji Sifangcai the third time.
The Chuzhou guihuaguan was really the dreamed place to work at. Black glasses, the green ground...
