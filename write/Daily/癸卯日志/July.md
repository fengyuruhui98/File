Once I filled my hand with mist, Then I open it and lo, the mist was a worm, and I closed and opened my hand again, and behold there was a bird, and again I closed and open my hand, and in its hollow stood a man with a sad face, turned upward. And again I closed my hand, and when I opened it there was naught but mist. But I heared a song of exceeding sweetness.
